Bias in estimates of size and age at maturity can arise when disparate distributions of mature and immature fish within a population are not accounted for in the analysis. Here we investigate the spatial and temporal variability in observed size and age at maturity of female albacore tuna, {\textbackslash}textlessitalic{\textbackslash}textgreaterThunnus alalunga{\textbackslash}textless/italic{\textbackslash}textgreater, using samples collected across the South Pacific. Maturity status was identified using consistent histological criteria that were precise enough to allow for mature but regenerating females to be distinguished from immature females during the non-spawning season, permitting year-round sampling for maturity estimation in albacore. Using generalised linear mixed models, we found that the proportion of mature females at length varied significantly with latitude and time of year. Specifically, females at northern latitudes (10E0?E??S, where spawning occurs) were mature at significantly smaller lengths and ages than females at southern latitudes (?E??20?E0?E??S), particularly during the spawning season (October�March). This variation was due to different geographic distributions of mature and immature fish during the year. We present a method for estimating an unbiased maturity ogive that takes into account the latitudinal variation in proportion mature at length during a given season (spawning or non-spawning). Applying this method to albacore samples from the western region of the South Pacific gave a predicted length at 50\% mature of 87 cm fork length (4.5 years).{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

The remainder is landed in longline fisheries directed at BET and sold as fresh or frozen tuna at prices greater than US\$10/kg. The combined fishing mortality by all gears will soon reduce the BET biomass in the Pacific Ocean to less than that capable of producing maximum sustainable yield. Closure of the high-seas enclaves in 2009 was hailed as a conservation measure, but was not scientifically evaluated before implementation and appears to have had no beneficial effect on the BET stock. A spatially explicit age-structured ecosystem model, SEAPODYM, is used to simulate alternative area-based fishery management policies to conserve bigeye tuna in the Western Central Pacific Ocean. Closing the high-seas enclaves to purse seine fishing has negligible effect on the BET biomass. Fishery management policies that control mortality on both juveniles and adults, through prohibition of fish aggregation devices in the purse seine fishery and restrictions on longline fishing in spawning areas, are the most efficient conservation policies. Large-scale benefits from bigeye conservation measures will become apparent only in the 2030s, assuming timely implementation and minimal effects of climate change.},

Experiments were conducted to evaluate a fishing captain's ability to predict species composition, sizes, and quantities of tunas associated with drifting fish-aggregating devices (FADs), before encirclement with a purse-seine net. Operating in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean, during 11 May - 23 July 2011, Captain Ricardo Diaz detected small quantities of bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas within large FAD-associated aggregations dominated by skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). The captain's predictions were significantly related to the actual total catch and catch by species, but not to size categories by species. His predictions of species composition were most accurate when estimates of bigeye and yellowfin tuna were combined. If purse-seine captains are able to make accurate predictions of the proportion of bigeye and yellowfin tunas present in mixed-species aggregations associated with FADs, managers may wish to consider incentives to fishers to reduce the fishing mortality on those species.},

	abstract = {The interspecific preferences of fishes for different depths and habitats suggest fishers could avoid unwanted catches of some species while still effectively targeting other species. In pelagic longline fisheries, albacore (Thunnus alalunga) are often caught in relatively cooler, deeper water ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater100 m) than many species of conservation concern (e.g., sea turtles, billfishes, and some sharks) that are caught in shallower water ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless100 m). From 2007 to 2011, we examined the depth distributions of hooks for 1154 longline sets (3,406,946 hooks) and recorded captures by hook position on 2642 sets (7,829,498 hooks) in the American Samoa longline fishery. Twenty-three percent of hooks had a settled depth {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextless100 m. Individuals captured in the 3 shallowest hook positions accounted for 18.3\% of all bycatch. We analyzed hypothetical impacts for 25 of the most abundant species caught in the fishery by eliminating the 3 shallowest hook positions under scenarios with and without redistribution of these hooks to deeper depths. Distributions varied by species: 45.5\% (n = 10) of green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), 59.5\% (n = 626) of shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), 37.3\% (n = 435) of silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), and 42.6\% (n = 150) of oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus) were caught on the 3 shallowest hooks. Eleven percent (n = 20,435) of all tuna and 8.5\% (n = 10,374) of albacore were caught on the 3 shallowest hooks. Hook elimination reduced landed value by 1.6 - 2\%, and redistribution of hooks increased average annual landed value relative to the status quo by 5-1.7\%. Based on these scenarios, redistribution of hooks to deeper depths may provide an economically feasible modification to longline gear that could substantially reduce bycatch for a suite of vulnerable species. Our results suggest that this method may be applicable to deep-set pelagic longline fisheries worldwide.Compensaciones entre Captura, Captura Accesoria y Valores Asentados en la Pesquera de L�nea Larga de Samoa Americana},

	abstract = {Large reductions in the abundance of exploited land predators have led to significant range contractions for those species. This pattern can be formalized as the range-abundance relationship, a general macroecological pattern that has important implications for the conservation of threatened species. Here we ask whether similar responses may have occurred in highly mobile pelagic predators, specifically 13 species of tuna and billfish. We analyzed two multidecadal global data sets on the spatial distribution of catches and fishing effort targeting these species and compared these with available abundance time series from stock assessments. We calculated the effort needed to reliably detect the presence of a species and then computed observed range sizes in each decade from 1960 to 2000. Results suggest significant range contractions in 9 of the 13 species considered here (between 2\% and 46\% loss of observed range) and significant range expansions in two species (11-29\% increase). Species that have undergone the largest declines in abundance and are of particular conservation concern tended to show the largest range contractions. These include all three species of bluefin tuna and several marlin species. In contrast, skipjack tuna, which may have increased its abundance in the Pacific, has also expanded its range size. These results mirror patterns described for many land predators, despite considerable differences in habitat, mobility, and dispersal, and imply ecological extirpation of heavily exploited species across parts of their range.},

	abstract = {Release and recovery files from the world's five major constituent-based billfish (Istiophoridae) tagging programs were assembled into a single composite database. Data sources included the National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) Cooperative Tagging Center (MIA) in the Atlantic Ocean, the NMFS's Cooperative Billfish Tagging Program (LJA) in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the Australian Cooperative Tagging Program in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the New Zealand Cooperative Game Fish Tagging Program in the Pacific Ocean, and The Billfish Foundation's (TBF) tagging program in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Results for the main target species, including black marlin (Makaira indica), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) and sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) were compared and contrasted based on species, ocean body and tagging program. A total of over 317 000 billfish have been tagged and released, and 4122 have been recovered since 1954. Tag recovery percentages were generally higher for a recently developed double-barb nylon anchor tag compared with the typically used stainless steel dart tag. Greatest distances moved were largest for blue marlin and black marlin, followed by striped marlin, white marlin and sailfish. The TBF program had the highest tag recovery percentages for white marlin (2.4\%) and blue marlin (1.7\%), whereas the MIA program had the highest percentage recovery for sailfish (1.8\%). The LJA program had the highest recovery percentages for black marlin (1.9\%) and striped marlin (1.4\%). The annual number of releases and recoveries for each target species tended to increase over the time series, particularly during the last decade. Cyclic annual movement patterns and/or seasonal site fidelity were evident for black marlin and white marlin. The data suggest that tag recovery percentages can be affected by tag type, reporting rate, localized fishing activities, outreach activities, and a variety of logistical issues indirectly related to size of ocean body. The efficiencies of the tagging programs are compared and recommendations are made to improve the programs. The composite tagging database provides the opportunity for a more comprehensive evaluation of the data and tagging programs than has previously been possible by examining the individual programs in isolation. The main advantage of constituent-based tagging programs is that large numbers of billfish can be tagged at a minimum cost. The main drawbacks are a lack of control over the tagging event and return of recovery data. Constituent-based tagging programs provide essential data on billfish movement and biology, and should be expanded and improved to meet the increasing need for this information.},

	abstract = {Istiophorid billfishes are highly migratory species that inhabit the tropical and subtropical, epipelagic waters of the world's oceans, a large, relatively homogeneous environment that lacks significant physical barriers. Based on these observations alone, one would not expect marlins, sailfish and spearfishes to exhibit substantial stock structure. This assumption has been evaluated with a variety of techniques, including analyses of morphological characters, adult distribution, tag and recapture data, the spatial and temporal distribution of spawning and, recently, molecular genetic characters. This paper focuses on inferences of istiophorid billfish stock structure derived from investigation of several different classes of molecular markers, and reviews our current understanding of the genetic basis of stock structure of striped marlin, white marlin, blue marlin, sailfish and black marlin. Significant genetic differences exist between Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of blue marlin and sailfish, and the presence of distinct mitochondrial DNA lineages suggests that ocean populations were isolated in the past. However, the occurrence of identical genotypes in both oceans is evidence of recent genetic contact. The genetic data do not support recognition of separate Atlantic and Indo-Pacific species of blue marlin or sailfish. White and striped marlin are separated by about the same level of genetic divergence as Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of blue marlin and sailfish, but preliminary analysis of the mitochondrial DNA control region suggests that, unlike Atlantic and Indo-Pacific populations of blue marlin and sailfish, white marlin and striped marlin represent independent evolutionary units. If white and striped marlin are valid species, they are of very recent origin. Significant intraspecific genetic heterogeneity was found among collections of striped marlin and sailfish within the Indo-Pacific; both species exhibited a clear spatial partitioning of genetic variation among geographically distant collection locations. There was no genetic evidence for within-ocean population structuring for other istiophorids examined. Inferences of billfish stock structure derived from studies of molecular markers complement those obtained using other methods of analysis, and together these studies demonstrate substantial differences in the level of population structuring among istiophorid billfishes, information critical for effective management of these highly migratory species.},

@techreport{williams_overview_2020,
	title = {Overview of tuna fisheries in the western and central {Pacific} {Ocean}, incuding economic conditions-2019},
	abstract = {This paper provides a broad description of the major fisheries in the WCPFC Statistical Area (WCP-CA) highlighting activities during the most recent calendar year (2019) and covering the most recent summary of catch estimates by gear and species. The provisional total WCP–CA tuna catch for 2019 was estimated at 2,961,059 mt, the highest on record, at around 76,000 mt higher than the previous record catch in 2014 (2,885,042 mt). The WCP–CA tuna catch (2,961,059 mt) for 2019 represented 81\% of the total Pacific Ocean tuna catch of 3,656,813 mt, and 55\% of the global tuna catch (the provisional estimate for 2019 is 5,403,368 mt), both of which are records. The 2019 WCP–CA skipjack catch of 2,034,230 mt was a record and around 45,000 mt higher than the previous record in 2014 (1,978,927 mt). The 2019 yellowfin catch (669,362 mt) was the third highest on record, at around 44,000 mt less than the previous record in 2017. The high catches are related to some extent to recent high catch levels from the “other” category (primarily small-scale fisheries in Indonesia). The provisional WCP-CA bigeye catch (135,680 mt) for 2019 was lower than the recent ten-year average and amongst the lowest over the past two decades. The 2019 WCP–CA albacore catch (121,787 mt) was higher than the 2018 catch and similar to the recent ten-year average, but remained around 26,000 mt lower than the record catch in 2002 of 147,793 mt. The south Pacific albacore catch in 2019 (86,706 mt), was amongst the highest for this fishery, with the record catch taken in 2017 (93,415 mt). The provisional 2019 purse-seine catch of 2,060,412 mt was the highest on record, but only 1,000 mt higher than the previous record in 2014 (2,059,006 mt). The 2019 purse-seine skipjack catch (1,641,920 mt) was the highest on record, 32,000 mt higher than the previous record in 2014 (1,609,784 mt). The proportion of skipjack tuna (80\%) in 2019 purse seine tuna catch has the highest since the fishery was established in the 1960s. The 2019 purse-seine catch for yellowfin tuna (364,571 mt; 18\%) was over 130,000 mt lower than the record catch in 2017 (498,822 mt) but still amongst the highest annual catches for this fishery. The provisional catch estimate for bigeye tuna for 2019 (50,819 mt) was the lowest since 2003, and the proportion of bigeye tuna (2\%) represented in the purse seine tuna catch, the lowest since 1980. The relatively low bigeye tuna catch in 2019 appears to be related to both (i) a lower proportion of associated sets in 2019, and (ii) a lower proportion of bigeye tuna in the associated-set tuna species composition in 2019. The provisional 2019 pole-and-line catch (183,193 mt) was lower than the 2018 catch (231,155 mt) and amongst the lowest annual catches since the mid-1960s, due to reduced catches in both the Japanese and the Indonesian fisheries. The provisional WCP–CA longline catch (273,550 mt) for 2019 was at the average level for the past five years. The WCP–CA albacore longline catch (95,280 mt, 35\% of total catch) for 2019 was slightly higher than the recent ten-year average, and only 6,000 mt lower than the record of 101,820 mt attained in 2010. The provisional bigeye catch (68,371 mt, 25\% of total catch) for 2019 was slightly lower than the recent ten-year average, and well down on the bigeye catch levels experienced in the 2000s (e.g. the 2004 longline bigeye catch was 99,705 mt). The yellowfin catch for 2019 (104,440 mt, 38\% of total catch) was the highest catch since 1980 (which was a record for this fishery at 125,113 mt). The 2019 South Pacific troll albacore catch (3,425 mt) which was the highest catch since 2008 (3,502 mt). The New Zealand troll fleet (144 vessels catching 2,272 mt in 2019) and the United States troll fleet (16 vessels catching 475 mt in 2019) accounted for all of the 2019 albacore troll catch. Market prices in 2019 were mixed with prices for purse seine caught product generally declining after significant increases in 2016 and 2017, although yellowfin prices at Yaizu continued to move higher. Yaizu prices for pole and line caught skipjack also saw significant declines. Prices for longline caught yellowfin were mixed with prices for fresh imports into the US and Japan increasing while fresh and frozen prices at Japanese ports declined. Prices for longline caught bigeye in 2019 rose by between 5\% and 14\% across the selected markets. Thai imports prices for albacore have risen significantly since 2017 with the 2019 average being the highest seen since 2012 while for June 2019 (the latest period for which data is available) the average price exceeded \$4,000/mt for the first time. The total estimated delivered value of the tuna catch in the WCP-CA increased by 1\% to \$6.01 billion in 2019. The value of the purse seine catch (\$3.26 billion) accounted for 54\% of the total value of the tuna catch. The value of the longline fishery increased 16\% to \$1.72 billion accounting for 29\% of the total value of the tuna catch. The value of the pole and line catch continued to decline to be at \$343 million in 2019 with the catch by other gears valued at \$669 million. The 2019 WCP–CA skipjack catch was valued at \$2.95 billion, the yellowfin catch at \$1.92 billion, the bigeye catch at \$780 million its highest level since 2014, and the albacore catch at \$360 million. Economic conditions in 2019 in the purse seine, tropical longline and southern longline fisheries of the WCP-CA showed mixed results. In the tropical purse seine fishery despite falls in prices and increases in fuel costs a surge in catch rates saw the continuation of good economic conditions. In the southern and tropical longline fishery after recent improvements economic conditions have again deteriorated as catch rates fall and fuel costs rise.},

	abstract = {A research programme was carried out in French Polynesia to study tuna behaviour using acoustics and fishing experiments. Acoustics are of great importance for the study of tuna behaviour and estimation of abundance but estimates of individual target strength that are available are particularly inaccurate. In this study, four yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and two bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) of weight 4-50 kg were individually caught, identified, and equipped with ultrasonic tags for telemetry experiments. While tracking the fish, simultaneous underwater acoustic data were recorded with a split-beam echosounder in order to estimate their in situ acoustic target strength. It was observed that target strength was stronger when fish were diving than when they were ascending toward the surface. This can be explained by the tilt angle orientation of the swimbladder. A target strength bias according to depth was also observed.},

	abstract = {The retrospective problem involves systematic differences in sequential population analysis (SPA) estimates of stock size or some other quantity in a reference year. The differences occur as successively more data are used for estimation, and they appear to be structural biases caused by a mis-specification of the SPA. In some cases the retrospective problem is so severe that the SPA is considered to be too unreliable for stock assessment purposes. There are many possible sources of retrospective patterns, and it is usually difficult in practice to determine which are more likely. We propose diagnostics to help determine the more likely causes. We use local influence diagnostics to investigate whether small changes or perturbations to SPA input components such as catches or natural mortalities can remove or reduce retrospective patterns. We show, for the fall-spawning herring stock in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence SPA, that relatively small age- and year-specific changes to the SPA assumptions about the proportional relationship between an abundance index and stock size can result in greatly reduced retrospective patterns. We therefore conclude primafacie that these assumptions are a plausible source of the retrospective pattern. Larger changes to catches, natural mortality assumptions, or estimation weights are required to reduce the retrospective pattern. These other factors seem to be less plausible sources of the retrospective pattern, although this is best assessed by the herring stock experts who are more knowledgeable about the fishery and other scientific information for this stock.},

	abstract = {We assess the performance of circle hooks, which are promoted as a measure for improving the survival of marine turtles following interactions with pelagic longlines. We conducted experiments off eastern Australia on commercial fishing vessels that alternated circle hooks (mostly size 14/0) and Japanese tuna hooks along their longlines. Most animals were hooked in the lip or jaw, regardless of hook type. There was no difference in the mean size of animals caught on the two types of hook, except for striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax), which tended to be larger on tuna hooks. Most species had an equal or lower probability of being alive on circle hooks than tuna hooks. Catch rates on circle hooks exceeded those on tuna hooks for most species. These included several target species, such as albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and striped marlin, and bycatch, including several shark species. The differences in catch rates were large enough to increase total catches and financial returns. The financial benefits of increased catches outweighed the costs of converting to circle hooks. The results indicate that the adoption of small circle hooks by longliners will not be detrimental to financial returns.},

	abstract = {Summary Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many taxa, including bees, plants, birds, butterflies and fishes. A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs. To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977?2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast. In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator). We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.},

	abstract = {Fisheries scientists provide stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments to support interdisplinary fisheries management in the US and worldwide. These assessment activities have evolved different models, using different review standards, and are communicated using different vocabulary. Recent research shows that spatio-temporal models can estimate population density for multiple locations, times, and species, and that this is a “common currency” for addressing core goals in stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments. I therefore review the history and “design principles” for one spatio-temporal modelling package, the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package. I then provide guidance on fifteen major decisions that must be made by users of VAST, including: whether to use a univariate or multivariate model; when to include spatial and/or spatio-temporal variation; how many factors to use within a multivariate model; whether to include density or catchability covariates; and when to include a temporal correlation on model components. I finally demonstrate these decisions using three case studies. The first develops indices of abundance, distribution shift, and range expansion for arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) in the Eastern Bering Sea, showing the range expansion for this species. The second involves “species ordination” of eight groundfishes in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey, which highlights the different spatial distribution of flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon) relative to sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) and dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). The third involves a short-term forecast of the proportion of coastwide abundance for five groundfishes within three spatial strata in the US West Coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and predicts large interannual variability (and high uncertainty) in the distribution of lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus). I conclude by recommending further research exploring the benefits and limitations of a “common currency” approach to stock, ecosystem, habitat, and climate assessments, and discuss extending this approach to optimal survey design and economic assessments.},

	abstract = {A new and comprehensive migration route of skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, in the western Pacific Ocean was observed from the results of a large scale tagging project conducted from 2010 to 2016. Skipjack were implanted with archival tags in the peritoneal cavity and released from a subtropical area (STA), the Nansei Islands (NSI) and the Kuroshio Extension Area (KEA). Individuals released around the NSI displayed strong residency in that area. On the other hand, individuals released around the STA and KEA demonstrated seasonal northward movements. Three major potential routes were observed with strong skipjack residency along; (i) the Kuroshio in the NSI, and with seasonal northward movements along (ii) the Kyushu-Palau ridge and (iii) the Izu-Ogasawara Islands. During northward migration, the skipjack experienced several specific physical oceanographic structures such as the Kuroshio recirculation area (subtropical mode waters), the Kuroshio Current near the coast of Japan, the Kuroshio Extension and the Kuroshio–Oyashio transition area. However, during their journey the skipjack did not enter water with temperatures of ≤18 °C (defined as the lower thermal limit). Furthermore, the depth of the lower thermal limit is progressively shoaled at higher latitudes due to the distribution of colder water masses below 18 °C, which further limits the vertical distribution of skipjack. Our findings are the first fishery-independent observations on the degree of horizontal and vertical habitat of skipjack tuna in the western Pacific Ocean, which can be strongly driven by behavioural responses to the lower thermal limit.},

Fish were caught using typical recreational fishing methods and 80 pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed with new software and mechanical release mechanisms that allowed tags to detach and transmit early if the fish died. The first year study was also designed to compare the effectiveness and associated mortality of circle hooks versus J-hooks, while the second year study compared offset and non-offset circle hooks. All fish were caught on live bait. Circle hooks were found to be equally effective in hooking and landing striped marlin and far less likely to cause serious bleeding or become lodged in areas other than the mouth. Non-offset and 5° offset circle hooks had very similar performance. Depth and temperature records allowed us to determine the fate of individual marlin following release. In total, 16 of 61 fish died (mortality rate of 26.2\%), all within 5 days of release (mean 1.5 days). Injury was a clear predictor of mortality; 100\% of fish that were bleeding from the gill cavity died, 63\% of fish hooked deep died, and 9\% of those released in good condition died.},

	abstract = {A 25-year time series of striped marlin catch per unit effort (CPUE) data has been collected from gamefish charter skippers fishing the north-east coast of New Zealand. The CPUE averaged over the whole gamefishing season ranged from 0.053 striped marlin per charter boat day in 1984–1985 to 0.269 striped marlin per charter boat day in 1998–1999. This study investigates the amount of the variability in gamefish charter CPUE that can be explained by environmental and fishing-related factors for the period 1981–1997. Factors investigated were sea surface temperature during the fishing season, El Niño southern oscillation index, the position of the 20°C isotherm at the beginning of the fishing season, annual commercial catch of striped marlin in the New Zealand 200 mile zone and surface longline CPUE in the wider south-west Pacific. A stepwise multiple regression was used to develop a model of recreational striped marlin CPUE to determine the factors that best accounted for the variation observed. Surface longline CPUE in the general south-west Pacific (10°S–40°S latitude, 165°E–160°W longitude) had the strongest correlation with recreational CPUE (P = 0.001), but a poor correlation was found with longline CPUE from the western Tasman Sea and Coral Sea (10°S–40°S latitude, 145°E–165°E longitude). The total surface longline catch of striped marlin in New Zealand each season was negatively correlated with recreational CPUE (P = 0.019), which indicates a possible interaction between these fisheries.},

	abstract = {Decades of billfish tagging studies have been hindered by below-par conventional tag recovery rates and high rates of premature satellite pop-up tag shedding. With hopes of obtaining long-term tracking data, we performed the world’s first archival tagging study on an istiophorid, surgically implanting 99 archival tags into the peritoneal cavity of striped marlin (Kajikia audax) off the coast of Baja California, Mexico. Marlin were also tagged externally with a conventional tag before release. Ten archival tags (10.1\%) were recovered with days at liberty (DAL) ranging from 400 to 2795. Nine recoveries were from Mexican waters, whereas one marlin was recaptured off Ecuador. In total, 100\% of the light stalks on the archival tags failed, with nine failing within the first 3 months of deployment; because the light data are used to estimate the geographic position of the tagged fish, tracking data were compromised. The absence of conventional tags on all recaptured marlin indicates that studies of marlin using conventional tags have been hindered by tag shedding rather than tagging-associated mortality or underreporting. Our high recapture rate and long DAL suggest istiophorid science could be greatly advanced by archival tagging if new tag designs or methods can eliminate tag failure.},

	abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

	abstract = {The relationship between body weight and natural mortality in juvenile and adult fish was analysed for different aquatic ecosystems: lakes, rivers, the ocean, and pond, cage and tank aquaculture systems. Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters b (exponent) and Mu (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters b=−0.288 (90\% CL[−0.315, −0.261]) and Mu=3.00 (90\% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year−1. Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about b=−0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year−1) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year−1), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Two mitochondrial DNA segments of the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses of these segments were used for the genetic stock study. The variation in a segment flanking the ATPase and COIII genes was low; only two genotypes (α and β) were detected by RsaI digestion. Yet a large difference in the genotype distribution was observed between ocean basin samples. The α type predominated in four Atlantic samples, where 178 of 244 individuals were the α type. In contrast, only one of 195 individuals collected in the Indo-Pacific was the α type? The frequency of the α type varied considerably from 0 to 80\% among seven samples collected off the Cape of Good Hope. The variation found in the other segment, containing the D-loop region, was much higher; two endonucleases (DpnII and RsaI) detected five genotypes each and 15 composite genotypes. A highly significant difference in genotype frequencies was observed between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific samples, but no heterogeneity was observed among the four Atlantic or among four Indo-Pacific samples. These results clearly indicate that not only gene flow, but also fish migration, between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are severely restricted, and that fishes from these distinct stocks are intermingling around South Africa. The simple and diagnostic genetic marker found in this study can be used to estimate mixing ratios between Atlantic and Indian stocks around South Africa.},

	abstract = {Abstract The South African (SAF) yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) fishery represents a potential example of misalignment between management units and biological processes. The SAF fishery spans an operational stock with a boundary at 20°E, either side of which fish are considered part of Atlantic or Indian Ocean regional stocks. However, the actual recruitment of fish from Atlantic and Indian Ocean spawning populations into SAF waters is unknown. To address this knowledge gap, genomic analysis (11 101 SNPs) was performed on samples from Atlantic and Indian Ocean spawning sites, including SAF sites spanning the current stock boundary. Outlier loci conferred high discriminatory power to assignment tests and revealed that all SAF fish were assigned to the Indian Ocean population and that no Atlantic Ocean fish appeared in the SAF samples. Additionally, several Indian Ocean migrants were detected at the Atlantic spawning site demonstrating asymmetric dispersal and the occurrence of a mixed-stock fishery in Atlantic waters. This study highlights both the spatial inaccuracy of current stock designations and a misunderstanding of interactions between the underlying biological units, which must be addressed in light of local and global declines of the species. Specifically, the entire SAF fishery must be managed as part of the Indian Ocean stock.},

A total of 1483 (704 females and 779 males) YFT was collected on a weekly sampling at the fishing port of Abidjan, and ovaries of 527 females (76.4-166 cm FL) were analyzed for histology. A high reproductive activity of females was observed during boreal winter (December to April), being significantly active in December-January. L50 was estimated at 99.2 cm FL. Condition index analysis during the spawning season did not show a clear pattern on energy allocation strategy for reproduction. However, the assessment of gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HIS) indices during the ovarian development described an accumulative pattern with the highest values in spawning females. Mean batch fecundity was estimated at 2.91±1.22 million oocytes and mean relative batch fecundity at 54.39±22.05 oocytes per fish gram.},

	abstract = {The study: Population structure of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (T.
obesus) in the Indonesian region.
Key issues
Indonesia’s pelagic fisheries resources are of considerable importance to the nation’s economy and as
an important source of protein for Indonesia’s large population of 261 million people. Two species of
critical importance to Indonesia and to neighbouring countries in the Indian and Western Pacific Ocean
regions are yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), and together
accounted for around 6.3\% of total value of Indonesia’s capture fisheries commodities in 2015 (MMAF
2016). Current assessments and management strategies are based on assumptions of single, separate
Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean stocks of both species. Understanding of connectivity of these
species across the Indonesian archipelago and adjoining oceans was considered a high priority for
improved management.
Primary objective
The overall objective of the ‘mother project’1, of which the population structure study was one of two
main components, was to improve Indonesia’s capacity to assess and manage its tuna fisheries by
addressing key information gaps, particularly for yellowfin tuna (YFT) and bigeye tuna (BET), and to
improve Indonesia’s pelagic fisheries research capacity. The immediate objective of this study was to
define the population structures of YFT and BET in Indonesia’s archipelagic waters and connectivity with
adjoining regions; and to communicate the study’s findings and recommendations to the Indonesian
and international science and policy communities.
Methodologies
Three independent, complementary techniques – genetics (next generation sequencing and Single
Nucleotide Polymorphism markers), otolith chemistry2 (analyses of stable isotopes and elements) and
occurrence of parasites – were used to determine the degree of population structure and connectivity
of YFT and BET between the central Indian Ocean, Indonesian archipelagic waters (IAW) and Western
Pacific Ocean.
Study outcomes
The three techniques provided outcomes that were consistent with the inference of multiple
populations for YFT and BET across the geographic range of the project. The outcomes of the genetics
analyses suggested at least 2 or 3 genetic groupings for both species, with clines of genetic variation
across the geographic range. The patterns of distribution of parasites suggested limited movement of
fish (both species) westwards from the IAW into the eastern Indian Ocean, and also little movement
from the Western Pacific Ocean westwards into the Indonesian archipelago, at least for the sizes
examined (typically 30 – 50 cm fork length). The overall outcome from the otolith chemistry analyses
was that the YFT and BET had not moved large distances in their first 4 – 6 months of life. These results
suggest that the current national and regional governance arrangements are likely to be consistent with
the structure and connectivity of YFT and BET populations. The study achieved capacity development

resources.
2 Otoliths are structures in the inner ear that can be ‘read’, similar to the growth rings of trees, to determine factors
such as the fish’s age. The chemical composition of specific sections can be compared with geographic variation in
ocean chemistry to indicate location at known ages and thus movement through time.POPULATION STRUCTURE STUDY - FINAL REPORT - ACIAR PROJECT FIS/2009/059

for Indonesian scientists in the analytical fields of three techniques, in addition to skills associated with
the large-scale sampling program.
Impacts anticipated
The population structure study, albeit a ‘first-look’ investigation involving only the juvenile life-history
stages of the two species, has outcomes that will be a valuable contribution to current considerations
by Indonesia and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (including as inputs into the structure
of regional stock assessments) on appropriate management for these globally significant resources. The
study’s results will play a key role in defining future research activities to further investigate the degree
of connectivity of the tuna populations in IAW and adjoining oceans, in particular the level of exchange
with the WCPO. The capacity developments achieved in the project will ensure Indonesia’s fisheries
scientists play key, prominent roles3 in the future research.
Recommendations
This project demonstrated that the question of connectivity between IAW and adjacent oceans can be
addressed through a combination of populations structure methods. Refining and extending these
result through multi-year sampling of spawning adults and/or larvae and use of methods that provide
more direct estimates of annual exchange between areas, such as close-kin Mark Recapture, should be
a high priority for future work.
There is an ongoing need for capacity development for Indonesia’s fisheries scientists in
population/stock structure research, to build on what has been achieved in this study.},

Growth band pairs (identified as translucent and opaque bands) were counted on images photographed from X-ray films of the vertebrae from the caudal peduncle region. The marginal increment ratio and centrum edge analysis indicated that a growth band pair was formed on the vertebral centrum once per year. The band pairs after the birthmark were counted from 2 to 11 for females and from 2 to 15 for males. The bias corrected Akaike information criterion indicated that the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) best fitted the observed total length (TL)-at-age data. The parameters of sex-specific VBGF were estimated as follows: for females, theoretical maximum length (L∞) mean±s.d.=330.4±46.6cm TL, growth coefficient k=0.164±0.057year–1 and theoretical age at length 0 (t0)=–1.29±0.78 years; for males, L∞=376.6±32.6cm TL, k=0.128±0.022year–1 and t0=–1.48±0.54 years. The longevities were estimated to be at least 16.8 and 21.6 years for females and males respectively.},

The model describes temporal and spatial population dynamics using continuous advection-diffusion-reaction equations with an ageing term. We introduce a method to account for seasonal spawning migrations as movements of population density modelled in a Eulerian framework. The aim of this study is to explore the capacity of SEAPODYM to predict complex spatial dynamics of highly migratory species that are consistent with available data and existing knowledge on albacore biology. The geo-referenced fisheries dataset used for model calibration includes effort, catch and length-frequency distributions, constituting the total fishing pressure on the South Pacific albacore population over more than thirty years of exploitation. The model is then validated on the fishing data for Atlantic albacore, thus providing evidence of estimated model parameter invariance with respect to space and time. Given the robustness of the results, the quantitative approach presented here could be used to assist stock assessment and to improve management advice.},

              Albacore tuna (
              Thunnus alalunga
              ) is an important target of tuna fisheries in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The commercial catch of albacore is the highest globally among all temperate tuna species, contributing around 6\% in weight to global tuna catches over the last decade. The accurate assessment and management of this heavily exploited resource requires a robust understanding of the species’ biology and of the pattern of connectivity among oceanic regions, yet Indian Ocean albacore population dynamics remain poorly understood and its level of connectivity with the Atlantic Ocean population is uncertain. We analysed morphometrics and genetics of albacore (n = 1,874) in the southwest Indian (SWIO) and southeast Atlantic (SEAO) Oceans to investigate the connectivity and population structure. Furthermore, we examined the species’ dispersal potential by modelling particle drift through major oceanographic features. Males appear larger than females, except in South African waters, yet the length–weight relationship only showed significant male–female difference in one region (east of Madagascar and Reunion waters). The present study produced a genetic differentiation between the southeast Atlantic and southwest Indian Oceans, supporting their demographic independence. The particle drift models suggested dispersal potential of early life stages from SWIO to SEAO and adult or sub-adult migration from SEAO to SWIO.},

From 686 non-empty stomachs collected between 2001 and 2015 across three biogeographic provinces, we describe the diet composition of albacore tuna, analyse its feeding habits and investigate the structure and diversity of mid-trophic-level communities. Epipelagic fish were found to be the principal prey by number and reconstituted weight; cephalopods were the second important prey group. Small organisms prevailed in the diet of albacore tuna, with predation on juvenile fish commonplace. Albacore tuna exhibits a flexible, opportunistic feeding strategy, from ram filter feeding on abundant schooling prey to visual predation on large individuals. Prey species richness varied highly across the region. Oligotrophic conditions within the subtropical gyre of the Indian Ocean generated the most diverse mid-trophic-level communities, with less diverse communities occurring in productive areas. Albacore tuna occupies a similar trophic niche throughout the global ocean, foraging on the same prey families and even species. This study indicates overall temporal stability of the Indian Ocean and south-east Atlantic ecosystems where principal prey species remain unchanged over decades.},

We measured stable isotopes (δ13C and δ18O) and trace elements (Mg, Mn, Sr, Ba) in otoliths of albacore collected from two feeding grounds, namely the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic offshore waters, and compared them among sampling locations and life history stages. Measurements in otolith core, post-core and edge were used to determine whether albacore from these two regions have the same nursery origin and migratory patterns. We found no clear evidence of distinct nursery grounds based on otolith core chemistry, but Sr:Ca and Mg:Ca were different in the post-core portions of albacore from the two locations, suggesting residency in different regions during the early juvenile stage. Otolith edge chemistry, particularly stable isotopes and Sr:Ca, proved to be a valuable tool for classifying individuals to their capture locations. Annual cycles of Sr:Ca ratios were visible along life history transects, likely reflecting migratory patterns between water masses of differing salinity, but the timing of Sr:Ca cycles differed between the two groups. Differentiation in trace element concentrations in the otolith post-core and the timing of Sr:Ca cycles suggest the occurrence of two migratory contingents of albacore in the north-east Atlantic Ocean.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
Population structure of North Pacific albacore (Thunnus alalunga) may be more complex than the current 
single-stock hypothesis given the apparent regional differences in size-at-age and movement patterns in the 
eastern North Pacific. In this study, otolith-based techniques were used to analyze the age structure, daily 
growth rates and hatch dates of 126 albacore collected 
from two regions in the eastern North Pacific (northern: {\textgreater}40˚N and southern: {\textless}40˚N) in July through October of 2010 and 2011. Juvenile albacore collected from 
the southern region had significantly larger size-at-age 
than those collected from the northern region over a 
similar age range examined (423–1254 days). No significant regional difference in growth rates of juvenile 
albacore was detected over the ages examined, suggesting processes occurring in the first year and a half of life 
may have been driving regional size-at-age differences. 
Back-calculated hatch dates suggest protracted spawning for fish from both regions ranging from February 
to September with peak hatch dates between April and 
July (73\% of all fish). Results from this two-year study 
suggest that juvenile albacore length-at-age estimates in 
the eastern North Pacific are region-specific and may 
need to be considered for future life history studies and},

	title = {A {Multifan}-{CL} stock assessment of south-west {Pacific} swordfish 1952-2007},
	abstract = {Executive Summary 
This paper describes a stock assessment for broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in the Southern
region of the WCPFC convention area (0-50○
S; 140○
E -130○
W) for the period 1952-2007 
(including constant catch projections to 2017). The previous assessment (covering the period up
to 2004) considered only the South-West Pacific (SWP) with an eastern bound of 175○
W. The 
inclusion of the South-Central Pacific (SCP) in 2008 was in response to a request from the 
Commission to revisit WCPFC Conservation and Management Measure (CMM) 2006-3, which
limits swordfish fishing effort in the southern WCPFC convention area, south of 20○
S. There was
a two-tiered approach to the assessment this year. The SWP was given the highest priority, 
because the evidence suggests that the population in this region may form a reasonably discrete
sub-population, and there is compelling evidence to indicate that the population has declined due 
to fishing. A combined assessment on the SWP-SCP region was attempted as a lower priority
because i) the available data in the SCP are poor, and ii) there is little evidence to suggest a strong 
link between the two populations (and it is plausible to assume that the SCP might be more closely
linked with the north-central and/or south-east Pacific).
In the SWP, swordfish have been taken primarily as by-catch in the Japanese tuna longline
fisheries since the 1950s, with reported annual catches fluctuating around 2000 t over the period 
1970-1996. Japanese catches declined since the late 1990s, when the targeted Australian and New 
Zealand longline fisheries rapidly developed, with total annual catches averaging around 4000 t
from 1997-2002. Catches have declined from 2002-2007, with total catches in 2006-7 now
around the levels observed prior to 1997. Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia 
have reported the largest catches among the Pacific Island nations. Standardized catch rates
declined substantially for all the major fleets during the period from around 1999-2004. Since
2004, there has been a substantial increase in the Australian and New Zealand catch rates,
however, the increase is not as evident in the Japanese fleet. Mean size composition has declined 
in the well-sampled Australian fishery since the mid 1990s. Most of the swordfish catch in the
SWP is taken in the region between 20-40○
S. 
The magnitude of the SCP swordfish catches has been comparable to the SWP since around 2000.
Unlike the SWP, the majority of the swordfish in the SCP have been taken as by-catch in the
equatorial tuna longline fisheries. Japanese SCP swordfish have been primarily a by-catch species 
since the early 1950s, and Korean catches began in the mid-1970s. Taiwanese fleets have taken 
substantial catches since {\textasciitilde}2000. Beginning in 2004, the Spanish fleet has rapidly expanded, and
this targeted fishery recorded the largest catches of all nations in the SWP-SCP in 2006. French
Polynesia, Cook Islands and Vanuatu represent the majority of the SCP Pacific Island catches.
There is no compelling evidence for changes in size composition in the SCP catches, however, 
size data are limited. Swordfish catch rates observed in the SCP suggest that swordfish abundance
is stable or increasing in recent years. However, the operational level data available for
conducting catch rate standardization analyses are limited, and some conflicting trends suggest
that targeting changes are affecting CPUE trends for at least some of the fleets. 
Major changes from the 2006 assessment include: 
• Two-three years of additional data, which includes informative contrast in catch levels
and CPUE in the SWP 
• Simplification of the spatial structure within the SWP 
• Quantification of swordfish mixing rates on the basis of recent Pop-up Satellite Archival 
Tags (PSAT) and conventional tagging studies 
• Correction of catch data from NZ ({\textasciitilde}25\% of landings were omitted in 2006) 
• Additional size composition data (NZ port sampling from 2006-7, Spanish observer data
from 2004) 
• Exploration of alternative growth curves and maturity schedules, in light of evidence of 
methodological variability among laboratories 
• Exploration of models that include the SCP population 
3This paper describes a quantitative stock assessment using MULTIFAN-CL software, while
parallel comparative work was undertaken with CASAL (WCPFC-SC4-2008/SA-WP-7). The SWP 
assessment involved a substantial exploration of model uncertainty, with 768 model specifications
proposed. All SWP models were age-structured (ages 0-19+), sex-aggregated, iterated on a
quarterly timestep (1952-2007), spatially-disaggregated into two roughly equal longitudinal units,
with 11 fisheries and 4 informative effort series. The varying model assumptions in the 
uncertainty ‘grid’ were explored in a balanced factorial design with: 
• 2 stock recruitment curve steepness priors (0.65, 0.9) 
• 2 diffusive mixing assumptions (0.05, 0.1 per quarter) 
• 8 growth rate / maturity / mortality options
• 2 recruitment deviation options (SD of log-normal deviates = 0.1, 0.5) 
• 2 sample size down-weighting options for catch-at-size likelihoods (1/5, 1/20) 
• 3 relative weighting options for CPUE indices (fleets weighted differently) 
• 2 selectivity constraint options 
From this combination of models, 192 (defined as the Most Plausible Ensemble - MPE) were
judged to be plausibly consistent with the data and prior expectations of the swordfish fisheries
and biology. 
The SWP stock status summary represents a synthesis of the results from all 192 models, from 
which we reach the following conclusions (estimates represent the median and range of the 
Maximum Posterior Density (MPD) estimates; it is shown in the text that the parameter estimation
error for any individual model is much less than the uncertainty among models): 
1) We consider relative biomass estimates for recent years to be the most reliable reference points,
because they are the most closely linked to the highest quality data, and are reasonably robust to 
the alternative model assumptions explored. In 2006, Total Stock Biomass (TSB) was considered
to be more reliable than Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) reference points. However, given the
recognition of additional uncertainty in growth rates in 2008, it is not clear that the TSB estimates 
are more robust than SSB. The Maximum Posterior Density results from the plausible model 
ensemble indicate:
• TSB(2007)/TSB(1997): median = 0.69, range = (0.55 – 0.83). 
• SSB(2007)/SSB(1997) = 0.58 (0.42 – 0.71). 
2) The ratio of TSB relative to the biomass estimated to have occurred in the absence of fishing 
(TSBNF) provides a measure of the fishery impact on the population that might be more 
meaningful than the biomass ratio at two points in time if the population has experienced nonstationary production dynamics (which many of these assessments suggest to some extent): 
• TSB(2007) / TSBNF(2007) = 0.58 (0.45 – 0.79) 
• SSB(2007) / SSBNF(2007) = 0.43 (0.31 – 0.63). 
3) The data are not sufficient to estimate a stock recruitment relationship reliably, and most of the
models explored suggest some form of long-term recruitment variability. This undermines the 
usefulness of the MSY-related reference points. However, in so far as these reference points have 
been calculated, all of the MPD estimates from the plausible model ensemble suggest that biomass 
(total and spawning) is above levels that would sustain MSY, and fishing mortality is below 
F(MSY). 
• TSB(2007)/TSB(MSY) = 1.57 (1.22 – 2.06) 
• SSB(2007)/SSB(MSY) = 1.98 (1.20 – 3.46) 
• F(2007)/F(MSY) = 0.44 (0.18 – 0.67) 
4) The stock projections (assuming deterministic future recruitment from the stock recruitment
relationship, and constant catches at 2007 levels), suggest that rebuilding would be likely: 
• TSB(2012) / TSB(2007) = 1.19 (1.03 – 1.54) 
• SSB(2012) / SSB(2007) = 1.21 (0.91 – 2.07) 
• TSB(2017) / TSB(2007) = 1.24 (1.05 – 1.64) 
4• SSB(2017) / SSB(2007) = 1.41 (0.94 – 2.30) 
• TSB(2012) / TSB(MSY) = 1.89 (1.38 – 2.94) 
• TSB(2017) / TSB(MSY) = 1.97 (1.43 – 2.99) 
Overall, the 2008 SWP assessment yields results that are consistent with the results presented in
the 2006 assessment. The uncertainty appears to be substantially reduced in 2008, in that the
models are much more consistent in their stock status inferences and none of the models yielded
results that were near the extremes that were judged to be plausible in 2006. There are two main
factors likely contributing to this perception of reduced uncertainty. First, the ‘one-way-trip’ 
nature of the fishery has been interrupted, with recent declines in catch and effort resulting in 
stock rebuilding, such that the exploitation history now has informative contrast that improves the
estimation of productivity. Second, the simplified spatial structure in the 2008 model reduces the 
flexibility for the model to create spatial refuges and ‘cryptic biomass’ reserves. 
An attempted assessment on the combined SW and SC Pacific was undertaken, with a similar 
approach to the SWP, and an uncertainty grid of 144 models fit. However, none of the results
were satisfying, for reasons that were anticipated during the 2006 assessment and discussed at the 
swordfish assessment workshop in April 2008 (WCPFC-SC4-2008/SA-IP-1). The nominal and 
standardized CPUE series from all the major fishing fleets in the SCP are either stable or show a
continuous upward trend for the last several years (up to 20 or more) that has been sustained
despite a rapid increase in catches. There is also a paucity of size composition data in the SCP.
Thus there are no informative signals in either the CPUE or size composition data with which to 
quantify the fishery impact on the SCP stock. If it is assumed that the SCP CPUE indices provide 
reasonable relative abundance indices, then all of the models estimate a trend in increasing
recruitment for most of the duration of the SCP fishery. In many cases, the models estimate very 
low stock recruitment curve steepness (i.e. a linear relationship between spawning biomass and
abundance), with the paradoxical suggestion that both biomass and recruitment are increasing over
time, despite very low MSY and chronic overfishing relative to MSY. In other cases, the models 
suggest that recruitment is stable or increasing, biomass is very high and the fishery catch is a 
negligible proportion of the stock. It is possible that the SCP is experiencing a long-term change
in recruitment productivity, in which case none of these models are very helpful for predicting
what will happen in the future. If this is true, it also suggests that the SCP swordfish population is
not rapidly mixing with the SWP population, as the general CPUE trends in the two areas are in
opposite directions despite a similar magnitude of catch removals. However, another plausible 
explanation for the increasing CPUE trends is a change in gear deployment practices in the SCP.
One can never be confident that commercial effort standardization is effectively creating an 
unbiased relative abundance index, and this is particularly true in the SCP, where little operational
data on setting procedures is available for the standardization analyses. The Taiwanese fleet in 
particular seems to have undergone a shift toward targeting swordfish. At present there is no
compelling evidence to indicate that the SC Pacific swordfish fishery is over-exploiting the stock,
but we do not consider the available data to be very convincing. 
Data and research priorities for further reducing uncertainties are discussed for both the SWP and
SCP swordfish population},

from the north-central Pacific Ocean (NCPO; Hawaii), which in turn was different from the south-western Pacific Ocean (SWPO; pooled eastern and western Australia).

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper explores the possibility of using the ensemble modelling paradigm to fully capture assessment uncertainty and improve the robustness of advice provision. We identify and discuss advantages and challenges of ensemble modelling approaches in the context of scientific advice. There are uncertainties associated with every phase in the stock assessment process: data collection, assessment model choice, model assumptions, interpretation of risk, up to the implementation of management advice. Additionally, the dynamics of fish populations are complex, and our incomplete understanding of those dynamics and limited observations of important mechanisms, necessitate that models are simpler than nature. The aim is for the model to capture enough of the dynamics to accurately estimate trends and abundance, and provide the basis for robust advice about sustainable harvests. The status quo approach to assessment modelling has been to identify the “best” model and generate advice from that model, mostly ignoring advice from other model configurations regardless of how closely they performed relative to the chosen model. We discuss and make suggestions about the utility of ensemble models, including revisions to the formal process of providing advice to management bodies, and recommend further research to evaluate potential gains in modelling and advice performance.},

Cluster and dynamic factor analysis provided similar groupings. Stocks exhibited a detectable degree of synchrony among species, in particular the hakes and lings from Australia, New Zealand, Chile, and South Africa. We tested three climate indices, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), to explore their relationship with fish stock recruitment patterns. The time series of IPO and SOI showed the strongest correlation with New Zealand hoki (blue grenadier, Macruronus novaezelandiae) and Australian jackass morwong (Nemadactylus macropterus) (r = 0.50 and r = –0.50), and SAM was positively related to Australian Macquarie Island Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) (r = 0.49). Potential linkages in recruitment patterns at sub-basin, basin, and multibasin scales and regional and global climate indices do account for some of the variation, playing an important role for several key Southern Hemisphere species.},

Analyses of electronic equipment on board Danish trawlers and gillnetters show that newer, larger vessels have a significantly higher “technological level” than older, smaller vessels. A hypothesis of linkage between fish-finding and navigation technology on board and standard vessel characteristics was tested based on the definition of a technological index. Using a proportional odds model, vessel length accounted for most of the variation in technological level on board, with odds of 1.17 (95\% confidence interval: 1.16–1.18) of a higher index value for each increase in vessel length of 1 m. Vessel age was also significantly correlated with index values. In considering the technological index as an indicator of fishing power, the results have important implications for capacity-reduction schemes intended to reduce harvest pressure on fish stocks. In the course of such structural management plans, older, smaller vessels of a fleet are often replaced with newer, larger vessels within a fixed or reduced nominal capacity limit (e.g. total fleet tonnage), but according to the findings presented, nominal capacity reduction in fleet level may be undermined by increases in individual vessel fishing power.},

            Numerous pelagic species are known to associate with floating objects (FOBs), including tropical tunas. Purse seiners use this behaviour to facilitate the capture of tropical tunas by deploying artificial drifting fish aggregating devices (dFADs). One major recent change has been the integration of echosounders in satellite-tracked GPS buoys attached to FOBs, allowing fishers to remotely estimate fishable biomass. Understanding the effects of this new technology on catch of the three main tuna species (yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares; bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus; and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis) is important to accurately correct for this change in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices used for stock assessments. We analysed catch data from the French purse seine fleet for the period 2010–2017 in the Indian Ocean to assess the impact of this fleet’s switch to echosounder buoys around 2012. Results indicate that echosounders do not increase the probability a set will be succesful, but they have a positive effect on catch per set, with catches on average increasing by ≈2−2.5 tonnes per set (≈10\%) when made on the vessel's own dFADs equipped with an echosounder buoy. Increases were due to a decrease in sets below ≈25 tonnes and an increase in those greater than ≈25 tonnes, with a non-linear transition around this threshold. This increase explains the considerable investment of purse seiners in echosounder buoys, but also raises concerns about bias in stock size estimates based on CPUE if we do not correct for this fishing efficiency increase.},

            Drifting Fish Aggregating Devices (dFADs) are a major fishing mode for tropical tuna purse seine fisheries worldwide. However, the extent of dFAD use remains poorly understood. We present novel approaches for estimating annual dFAD deployments and number of dFADs monitored by individual vessels, using empirical data and robust estimation procedures. We leveraged observer and logbook data, combined with new dFAD tracking data from the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) purse seine fishery, the largest tuna fishery in the world, to evaluate trends in dFAD use across the entire WCPO between 2011 and 2019. Average estimates ranged between 20 000 and 40 000 deployments per year, depending on the methodology, with the total number of deployments appearing relatively stable over the last decade. The median number of active buoys monitored per vessel per day ranged from 45 to 75 depending on the year, well below the current management limit of 350. Our results contrast with other oceans, having fewer buoys monitored per vessel, a unique stable trend, but overall number of deployments two times higher than any other ocean. This study provides a basis for improved monitoring and management of dFAD use in the WCPO, with applicability for other regions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Pacific Island countries have a substantial socio-economic dependency on fisheries. Skipjack tuna is one of the most important species in the Western Central Pacific (WCP) and its catches in this region exhibit a spatio-temporal variability influenced by ocean conditions, mainly the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study investigates the relationship between skipjack tuna catch amounts and environmental variables in the equatorial Pacific during 1990–2014, and evaluates the potential predictability of the catches based on their statistical relationship. A series of regressed and reconstructed spatial patterns of upper-ocean temperature, salinity, currents and precipitation represent ENSO-like variability, and their principal component time series are used to estimate the predictability of skipjack tuna catches in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). ENSO-like variability depicted from 100 m temperature and 5 m salinity in the equatorial Pacific exhibit a significant predictability for the annual catch amount in the FSM for several years with a training period of {\textgreater} 20 years. This suggests that the subsurface temperature or near surface salinity can be a better predictor of ecosystem variability than widely used sea surface temperature. Applications of this result to other species could have broad implications for the fishery industry in the WCP.},

	abstract = {SEAPODYM is a model developed for investigating spatiotemporal dynamics of fish populations under the influence of both fishing and the environment. The model simulates age-structured population dynamics using advection–diffusion–reaction equations describing movement, recruitment, and natural and fishing mortality. The dynamic processes are constrained by environmental data and distributions of prey species. Model parameter estimation using fishing data was implemented earlier based on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach and adjoint technique. Here, we describe the integration of tagging data into the existing MLE approach with application to skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the Pacific Ocean. We find that tagging data improve estimates of species habitat parameters and movement rates and hence allow better representation of spatial dynamics of fish population. Due to estimated lower diffusion and higher advection rates, the model predicts less non-observed “cryptic” biomass, which leads to the stock sizes being closer to those estimated by stock assessment models commonly used by tuna commissions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new comprehensive growth model which includes numerous historical models as special cases. The new model is derived from a concise biological principle which, unlike earlier theories, relates to growth acceleration. Properties of growth curves, such as asymptotic limits or inflection points, are shown to be incidental in this new context. Possible submodels include not only asymptotic growth (such as von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gompertz, or logistic growth) but also linear, quadratic, or exponential growth. By simple analysis of variance, the observed data can be used directly in deciding which type of model is most appropriate. The new model is cast in terms of parameters which have stable statistical estimates. From this perspective, it is shown how earlier formulations sometimes result in an endless computer search for optimal parameter estimates.Key words: Growth, asymptotic growth, von Bertalanffy, Richards, Gompertz, logistic, length at age, weight at age, nonlinear parameter estimation},

	abstract = {The natural mortality rate (M) of a fish stock is typically highly influential on the outcome of age-structured stock assessment models, but at the same time extremely difficult to estimate. In data-limited stock assessments, M usually relies on a range of empirically or theoretically derived M estimates, which can vary vastly. This article aims at evaluating the impact of this variability in M using seven Mediterranean stocks as case studies of statistical catch-at-age assessments for information-limited fisheries. The two main bodies carrying out stock assessments in the Mediterranean and Black Seas are European Union’s Scientific Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and Food and Agriculture Organization’s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM). Current advice in terms of fishing mortality levels is based on a single “best” M assumption which is agreed by stock assessment expert working groups, but uncertainty about M is not taken into consideration. Our results demonstrate that not accounting for the uncertainty surrounding M during the assessment process can lead to strong underestimation or overestimation of fishing mortality, potentially biasing the management process. We recommend carrying out relevant sensitivity analyses to improve stock assessment and fisheries management in data-limited areas such as the Mediterranean basin.},

We investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of the neutral and potentially adaptive genetic diversity in samples collected from waters near Micronesia, Marshall, Phoenix and Gilbert Islands and French Polynesia using genotyping by sequence and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Analysis of 144 individuals and 2,682 SNP did not provide any substantial evidence to challenge the current assumption of panmixia in the WCPO using putatively neutral loci. However, there was a signal of potentially adaptive divergence (

The geographic origin of these tuna remains to be determined, as the samples originate from tagging cruises that sample large schools of tuna, and some of those tuna have subsequently showed substantial movement. We highly recommend further studies involving large sample sizes of larvae and young-of-the-year across the region and over multiple years to uncover the underlying processes that are potentially driving adaptive divergence and to infer any biological significance it may have on conservation and management of tropical bigeye tuna fishery stock.},

              Knowing the distribution of fish larvae can inform fisheries science and resource management in several ways, by: 1) providing information on spawning areas; 2) identifying key areas to manage and conserve; and 3) helping to understand how fish populations are affected by anthropogenic pressures, such as overfishing and climate change. With the expansion of industrial fishing activity after 1945, there was increased sampling of fish larvae to help better understand variation in fish stocks. However, large-scale larval records are rare and often unavailable. Here we digitize data from Nishikawa
              et al
              . (1985), which were collected from 1956–1981 and are near-global (50°N–50°S), seasonal distribution maps of fish larvae of 18 mainly commercial pelagic taxa of the families Scombridae, Xiphiidae, Istiophoridae, Scombrolabracidae, and Scomberesocidae. Data were collected from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. We present four seasonal 1° × 1° resolution maps per taxa representing larval abundance per grid cell and highlight some of the main patterns. Data are made available as delimited text, raster, and vector files.},

Thus, efforts to explore and assess new fishing grounds were conducted by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) through M/V DA-BFAR. Assessment of the spawning and nursery grounds of tunas in the country’s EEZ was also undertaken to properly manage and conserve tuna stocks. The said assessment commenced in 2006 and is continuing up to the present. All the data from 2006-2018 were compiled, including the data from collaborative studies with the University of the Philippines-Marine Science Institute and Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center to create an overall profile of Scombridae’s abundance and distribution larvae in Philippine waters. The study results showed that family Scombridae is most abundant in the Philippine waters along Batanes-Polillo and areas off Eastern Luzon. Species diversity in Philippine waters was considerably high, with about six to eight dominant species. The most dominant species was Thunnus albacares., followed by Thunnus obesus, Auxis spp., Katsuwonus pelamis, unidentified Scombrid larvae, Rastrelliger spp., Thunnus alalunga, and Thunnus tonggol. The Scombridae species are diverse in the West Philippine Sea and Batanes-Polillo waters but not in Davao Oriental-Surigao waters.},

However, the knowledge of their basin-wide spawning and larval habitats, especially in a warming ocean, is limited. We use the largest available dataset on tuna and billfish larvae in the Pacific Ocean to build a geostatistical species-distribution model with high explanatory power. The results reveal the spatial distribution of tuna and billfish larvae through all seasons across the Pacific. The model also identifies the optimal temperature ranges for nine major species and assesses the potential impact of ocean warming on larval distributions. We additionally present evidence that environmental variables, such as pH, phosphate concentration, and sea-surface height, exert secondary effects on larval distributions that warrant further investigation. Our findings make a quantum leap in understanding the ecophysiology of tuna and billfish, providing valuable information for future conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {The impacts of climate change are expected to have profound effects on the fisheries of the Pacific Ocean, including its tuna fisheries, the largest globally. This study examined the combined effects of climate change on the yellowfin tuna population using the ecosystem model SEAPODYM. Yellowfin tuna fisheries in the Pacific contribute significantly to the economies and food security of Pacific Island Countries and Territories and Oceania. We use an ensemble of earth climate models to project yellowfin populations under a high greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC RCP8.5) scenario, which includes, the combined effects of a warming ocean, increasing acidification and changing ocean chemistry. Our results suggest that the acidification impact will be smaller in comparison to the ocean warming impact, even in the most extreme ensemble member scenario explored, but will have additional influences on yellowfin tuna population dynamics. An eastward shift in the distribution of yellowfin tuna was observed in the projections in the model ensemble in the absence of explicitly accounting for changes in acidification. The extent of this shift did not substantially differ when the three-acidification induced larval mortality scenarios were included in the ensemble; however, acidification was projected to weaken the magnitude of the increase in abundance in the eastern Pacific. Together with intensive fishing, these potential changes are likely to challenge the global fishing industry as well as the economies and food systems of many small Pacific Island Countries and Territories. The modelling framework applied in this study provides a tool for evaluating such effects and informing policy development.},

	abstract = {Large-scale, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) have been established in several locations in the Pacific and expansion of such areas to reach 30\% of the ocean area is actively promoted in some quarters. Justification for the establishment of large oceanic MPAs often includes the conservation benefits that they would bring for tuna stocks, which are the subject of important commercial fisheries in the Pacific. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the conservation efficacy of an existing MPA, the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) and a series of large hypothetical MPAs each constituting approximately 33\% of the western and central Pacific Ocean, for two important and contrasting tuna species, skipjack and bigeye tuna. The evaluation was conducted by comparing control and counterfactual simulations in which the estimated population and fishery dynamics of the species were modelled using a high-resolution modelling framework known as SEAPODYM (Spatial Ecosystem And Population DYnamics Model). We found that stock-wide conservation benefits of the PIPA for these species, assuming that total fishing effort is maintained, to be weak to non-existent, and only modest increases in spawning biomass of both species occur within and in the near vicinity of the PIPA itself. For the larger 33\% hypothetical MPAs, changes in stock-wide spawning biomass were estimated to be -0.1\% to +5.8\% for skipjack tuna and +4.8\% to +12.0\% for bigeye tuna. Conservation efficacy of MPAs for species such as tropical tunas is limited by their wide larval dispersal and high mobility of later life stages, which spatially dissipate the protective effects of MPAs. Also, the displacement of fishing effort from MPAs to areas remaining open can have negative consequences for stocks and fisheries performance in those areas. We conclude that large oceanic MPAs are not likely to be effective frontline management tools for tropical tunas and other species having similar life history characteristics.},

            The movements, and hence stock structures, of bigeye tuna, Thunnus obesus, and yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, remain poorly defined despite their importance to food security, livelihoods and government revenue in many nations. We examined the parasite fauna of juvenile bigeye tuna and juvenile yellowfin tuna from areas within and outside Indonesia to determine how far they may have moved since metamorphosis and acquisition of a piscivorous diet. Patterns in parasite data between collection areas were consistent between the two tuna species. Fish from two outlier areas, Maldives and the Solomon Islands, harboured a distinct parasite fauna from those from adjacent Indonesian areas, although occasionally showed similarity with those from within the Indonesian archipelago. Within Indonesia, the parasite data indicated that few juvenile fish moved west from the Pacific Ocean into the archipelago and few moved west from the archipelago into the eastern Indian Ocean. While sampling of adult fish is required to fully resolve the stock structure of both tuna species, the results provide a necessary first-step in examining structuring of the two tuna species in Indonesia and indicate that juveniles of both species may have more restricted movement than is recognized in current management arrangements.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus) were tagged and released
in the north-western Coral Sea off northern Queensland in 1991 and 1992. Over the next five years, recaptures were reported by Australian longline vessels based in Cairns and fishing in the release area, and by
industrial tuna fleets fishing in the adjacent western Pacific region, thus demonstrating clear links
between the tuna stocks in these areas. Some southerly movements of yellowfin, in particular, further suggested links with stocks supporting the longline fishery in the south-eastern Australian Fishing Zone.
Bigeye tuna tag returns and catch per unit effort by Cairns-based longliners showed a strong seasonal
signal, peaking in mid year. Yellowfin tag-return data displayed a similar, but weaker, seasonal pattern.
The data were analysed by use of tag-attrition models with seasonally variable catchability and with two
assumptions regarding changes in targeting of the two species by longliners during the study. Under both
assumptions, the local exploitation rates for yellowfin are low: about 0.07 in 1996. For bigeye, the local
exploitation rate in 1996 may have been as high as 0.30, warranting a cautious approach to further fishery
expansion in this area.},

However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate.
                Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE- (stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package’s use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software.
                We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of
                glm(), lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization).
                We hope that sdmTMB’s user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.},

              The conventional parametric approach to modeling relies on hypothesized equations to approximate mechanistic processes. Although there are known limitations in using an assumed set of equations, parametric models remain widely used to test for interactions, make predictions, and guide management decisions. Here, we show that these objectives are better addressed using an alternative equation-free approach, empirical dynamic modeling (EDM). Applied to Fraser River sockeye salmon, EDM models (
              i
              ) recover the mechanistic relationship between the environment and population biology that fisheries models dismiss as insignificant, (
              ii
              ) produce significantly better forecasts compared with contemporary fisheries models, and (
              iii
              ) explicitly link control parameters (spawning abundance) and ecosystem objectives (future recruitment), producing models that are suitable for current management frameworks.
            
          , 
            
              It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (
              Oncorhynchus nerka
              ) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with equivalent EDM formulations that explicitly use spawning stock and environmental variables to forecast recruitment. We find that EDM models produce more accurate and precise forecasts, and unlike extensions of the classic Ricker spawner–recruit equation, they show significant improvements when environmental factors are included. Our analysis demonstrates the strategic utility of EDM for incorporating environmental influences into fisheries forecasts and, more generally, for providing insight into how environmental factors can operate in forecast models, thus paving the way for equation-free mechanistic forecasting to be applied in management contexts.},

To manage marine resources effectively, it is necessary to adapt management to changes in the physical environment. Simple relationships between environmental conditions and fish abundance have long been used in both fisheries and fishery management. In many cases, however, physical, biological, and human variables feed back on each other. For these systems, associations between variables can change as the system evolves in time. This can obscure relationships between population dynamics and environmental variability, undermining our ability to forecast changes in populations tied to physical processes. Here we present a methodology for identifying physical forcing variables based on nonlinear forecasting and show how the method provides a predictive understanding of the influence of physical forcing on Pacific sardine.},

              Thunnus albacares
              is a commercially important fish species widely distributed between 40° S and 40° N. Mixing rates between tropical and temperate areas of the western Pacific Ocean were investigated using stable carbon (δ
              13

              otolith
              ) and oxygen isotopes (δ

              otolith
              ) in whole otoliths of small juveniles (mean: 5.8 cm standard length, SL) and in otolith cores of large juveniles (32.4 cm SL). The density distribution of δ
              18
              O
              otolith
              values for small juveniles showed a significant difference between the areas, whereas patterns for large juveniles were almost identical between areas. In addition, modal values for large juveniles spanned several small juvenile modes. The density distribution of δ
              13
              C
              otolith
              values for small juveniles had a single significantly different mode for each area, whereas the distribution of δ

              C
              otolith
              values for large juveniles in these areas was bimodal, particularly in the temperate area; these modes corresponded to those for small juveniles in each area. These modal patterns indicate that the majority of large juveniles captured in the temperate area have tropical origins, and mixing from tropical to temperate areas occurs between the areas before recruitment to fisheries in each area. These connectivity patterns during early life history can contribute to refinement of stock assessments of this commercially valuable species.},

	abstract = {The conclusions drawn from fisheries stock assessment models can depend strongly on the relative weights assigned to different data sets. However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},
